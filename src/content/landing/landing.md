Hi! I'm a front-end web developer who mainly specializes in 3D related web projects.
The majority of my experience is in creating PlayCanvas/VueJS apps that leverage PlayCanvas as a 3D game engine, and Vue for front-end UI.  However I also have a broad knowledge in many different platforms such as: 
-   
- React
-   Unity3D
-   Blender
-   Heroku
-   AWS
-   GraphQL
