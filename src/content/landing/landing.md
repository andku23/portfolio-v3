Hi! I'm a front-end web developer who mainly specializes in 3D related web projects.
My primary skill is in creating XR apps that leverage **Vue** for front-end UI and **PlayCanvas** as a 3D game engine.  However, I also have a broad knowledge in many different platforms such as: 

-   VueJS
-   React
-   Unity3D
-   Blender
-   Heroku
-   AWS S3
-   GraphQL
