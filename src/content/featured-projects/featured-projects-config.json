While each individual part was not too hard, combining volumetric video, location locked content, achievement tracking, and 9 holes of content running on mobile, was certainly a challenge.",

Essentially the app is just a fish tank app, where you create a fish, and then you can let it swim around in a larger aquarium app.  However the creator was a web app, and the aquariums were both web AND Unity, meaning the fish data had to be transformed into some data storable on a database.  The true hardest part, was getting the underwater scene to optimize to running on phone.  Lot of batching and writing instancing shaders on this one. ",
